# rc: micro bump

No code changes. Iterating on the deployment pipeline.


# wwt-aligner-frontend 0.2.0 (2021-01-15)

Initial test release of the WWT Aligner frontend, to see if we can correctly
publish our binaries to GitHub releases.

Eventually we could/should publish this as a crate to Cargo, but we don't expect
other crates to rely on this one, so it's not a priority.

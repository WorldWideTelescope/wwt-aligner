Welcome to the manual for the **WWT Aligner**, a tool that helps transfer
astrometric information from scientific data (e.g., [FITS files]) to press
release imagery (e.g., [JPEG files]).

The WWT Aligner is part of the [AAS](https://aas.org/) [WorldWide Telescope]
software system, although you do not need to use WWT in order for the Aligner to
be useful for you. The development of the WWT Aligner was sponsored by the [Space
Telescope Science Institute][stsci].

This command previews an [AAS WorldWide Telescope][wwt] [WTML] file in the WWT
web client.

[wwt]: https://worldwidetelescope.org/home
[WTML]: https://docs.worldwidetelescope.org/data-guide/1/data-file-formats/collections/

# Synopsis

```
wwt-aligner preview [--port=PORT] {WTML-PATH}
```

# Arguments

The `{WTML-PATH}` argument should be the name of a WTML file, most likely one
generated by the [wwt-aligner go][cli-go] command with its `-t` (`--tile`)
option.

[cli-go]: @/commands/go/index.md

The `--port=PORT` option allows you to override the default port number for the
preview HTTP service, which is 17001. You might need to use this if you want to
run multiple preview commands simultaneously.

The [generic command-line arguments](@/commands/_index.md#generic-command-line-arguments)
are also supported.

# Remarks

This program is somewhat limited in its funtionality because the HTTP server
runs inside the alignerâ€™s Docker container. For more a more featureful preview
system, install the [wwt_data_formats Python package][wwtdf] and use the
[wwtdatatool preview] and/or [wwtdatatool serve] commands. That package provides
a variety of other tools that are helpful for manipulating WTML files.

# wwt_aligner 0.5.0 (2021-06-02)

- A first pass of robustness improvements that help the Aligner succeed on a
  wider range of images. It now succeeds on approximately 50% of our library of
  testing images.
- Addition of some utilities for emitting diagnostics and plotting various data
  files to help diagnose cases where the Aligner fails
- Implement a new `wwt-aligner preview` command. This command allows you to
  preview the WWT-formatted version of a processed image using your computerâ€™s
  web browser. It requires special plumbing provided by the 0.4 version of the
  frontend component.


# wwt_aligner 0.4.1 (2021-03-02)

- Use portable compiler flags for the Docker build, so that the resulting image
  will run on a wide range of host systems. Astrometry.Net's build system
  reasonably defaults to aggressively tuning for the build host, but that's not
  the right choice for a Docker image.


# wwt_aligner 0.4.0 (2021-03-02)

Prototype release that might actually be functional. Mainly testing the
tweaked Docker deployment automation, though.


# wwt_aligner 0.3.1 (2021-01-15)

No code changes, trying Docker deployment again.


# wwt_aligner 0.3.0 (2021-01-15)

No code changes, trying Docker deployment again.


# wwt_aligner 0.2.0 (2021-01-15)

No code changes, trying Docker deployment again.


# wwt_aligner 0.1.0 (2021-01-15)

Initial prototype release. Note that our release artifact is the built Docker
image, not the Python module. For the time being we're not even publishing the
Python module to PyPI.
